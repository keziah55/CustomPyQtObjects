# CustomQObjects API

Some convenience classes for PyQt/PySide. CustomQObjects uses [qtypy](https://pypi.org/project/QtPy/), 
so should work with any up-to-date PyQt/PySide installation.

Customized QtWidgets are documented [here](widgets.md), QtCore objects [here](core.md)
and QtGui objects [here](gui.md).
